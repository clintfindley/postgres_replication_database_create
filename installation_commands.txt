I installed the binaries:

sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3 postgresql-contrib-9.3

./configure
gmake
gmake install


Then added the following lines to the .bash_profile and sourced it:


vi /etc/profile or ~/.bash_profile

add lines:
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	MANPATH=/usr/local/pgsql/share/man:$MANPATH
	export MANPATH
	PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH
	export PATH


I copied the postgresql.conf file into master and slave versions and made some edits. The resulting files are on the repo. I added replication to the pg_hba_[m/s].conf


Made a couple of links on the master:

ln -s /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba_master.conf /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf
ln -s /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql_master.conf /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf


And the slave:

ln -s /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba_slave.conf /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf
ln -s /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql_slave.conf /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf


Start database (commands needed)

Run the create scripts in the following order:

1) create_roles.sql
2) create_users.sql
3) create_grants.sql
4) create_sequences.sql
5) create_functions.sql
6) create_tables.sql


No changes were made to the recovery_master.conf file. If you need to recover or set that up you should make the changes at that time. The recovery_slave.conf was set to be a hot standby of production. 

On slave machine:
mkdir -p /home/postgres/trigger_file/ 

I ran the following command to establish replication (on master):

pg_basebackup -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main -h 192.168.2.21 -v -P -U replication --password --xlog-method=stream


At which point the databases were created, the users and internal to the database objects were created and replication established.
